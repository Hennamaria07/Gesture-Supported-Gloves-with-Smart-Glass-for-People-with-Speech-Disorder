# Gesture-Supported-Gloves-with-Smart-Glass-for-People-with-Speech-Disorder
The aim of our project is to provide a solution to individuals with speech disorders who face difficulties in communicating effectively. This innovative project combines two technologies: gesture recognition and smart glasses, to create a novel communication system. In our system we describes a smart speaking glove to impart an easier means of communication between speech impaired people and normal people using synthesized speech.A smart glove is incorporated with flex sensors whose,resistance value changes according to the gesture specified by the user.This gesture information is processed by a micro-controller and corresponding voice output is given through a paired android device.Also a smart glass is provided which is connected with the hand gloves which will show the important text messages on the glass and also an accelerometer is provided within the glass for doing head movement detection, which can be also utilized for controles.We use MQTT protocol for transmission in this system. Sign language is a method used for communication by disabled person. Here we are converting sign language into text and then to speech, utilizing data gloves communication barrier between two different communities is eliminated. Using data gloves disabled person can also grow in their carrier and makes nation grow as percentage of disabled person are millions in count.
